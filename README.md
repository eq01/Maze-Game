# Maze-Game | Java (Co-developed)
Interactive maze game built in Java, featuring real-time visualization, maze generation with Kruskal’s algorithm, and automated or manual maze-solving.

Features:

- Maze generation: Procedurally generates mazes using Kruskal’s algorithm.

- Manual gameplay: Move the player using arrow keys to reach the bottom-right exit.

- Automated solving: Solve the maze programmatically using BFS or DFS algorithms.

- Real-time visualization:

- Player’s current position highlighted in turquoise.

- Visited cells highlighted in light blue.

- Solved path highlighted in darker blue.

- Movement restrictions: Player cannot move through walls; after maze is solved, only a new maze can be generated.

- Clean architecture: Utilized graph algorithms, union-find structures, generics, deques, and iterators for modular, maintainable code.

User Guide:

Goal: Reach the bottom-right corner of the maze (the exit).

- Key Movement:

  - UP Key – Move player up

  - DOWN Key – Move player down

  - LEFT Key – Move player left
  
  - RIGHT Key – Move player right
  
- Special Commands:
